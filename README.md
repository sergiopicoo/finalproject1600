# Final Project IT 1600
By: Sergio Pico
  
Tutorial meant for students ages 15-20. This tutorial is meant for people that are thinking about certain types of technologies they want to work with/learn about during their college and high school years. 
  
The purpose of this tutorial is raising awareness about the impressive evolution of wireless communications throughout the years and it always evolving use. This tutorial will cover challenges, advantages, applications and much about regarding 5G technologies. 

## 5G and the Evolution of Mobile Wireless Communications

Welcome to my final for INFOTC 1600 at Mizzou. My name is Sergio Pico and I will be going over 5G Wireless technologies and their uses, etc.   

5G is the latest generation of cellular mobile communications. There is a misconception that 5G stands for 5Gb when it reality it stands for 5th generation. It follows 4G, 3G, 2G systems that were primarily in use during the past decades. 5G developers seeked to be able to transfer high data rates, reduced latency, more energy efficient and reduce costs for everyone. It also improves the capacity and device connectivity massively compared to older generations. This generation of wireless communications is meant to offer new consumer and business applications with near real-time connectivity. With the [Internet of things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) expanding greatly to fridges, alarm clocks, cars, thermostats, and many more the capacity of 4G would have simply not been enough to keep up.     


### **Cases where 5G is being used**

*5G has paved a path for many new technologies to develop at the level that we need them to perform.*
